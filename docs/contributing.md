Pull requests are always welcome!
Here are the main things that we feel need to be worked on

- Code quality
    - Fanbox was made in a 12-hour hackathon and the quality (or lack of) reflects this. Anyone well versed in JS is a major asset!
- Themes
    - Fanbox currently comes with 3 themes. However, we're not designers and can't make things look good to save our lives. Anyone comfortable with HTML and CSS should feel comfortable styling a Fanbox theme.
- Charts
    - Fanbox uses C3 for most charts and we're only using 1/100th of its full potential. The more charts we can offer the user, the better!
- Docs
    - Any additional things that you feel should be part of the docs? Put them in!
- Everything else
    - Suggestions on what could be improved, missing features, bugs etc... All of these are needed to take over the world

## Thanks for the contributions!
